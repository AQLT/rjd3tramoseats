\title{Refresh a specification with constraints}
\usage{
tramo_refresh(
  spec,
  refspec = NULL,
  policy = c("FreeParameters", "Complete", "Outliers_StochasticComponent", "Outliers",
    "FixedParameters", "FixedAutoRegressiveParameters", "Fixed", "Current"),
  period = 0,
  start = NULL,
  end = NULL
)

tramoseats_refresh(
  spec,
  refspec = NULL,
  policy = c("FreeParameters", "Complete", "Outliers_StochasticComponent", "Outliers",
    "FixedParameters", "FixedAutoRegressiveParameters", "Fixed", "Current"),
  period = 0,
  start = NULL,
  end = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{spec}{the current specification to be refreshed (\code{"result_spec"}).}

\item{refspec}{the reference specification used to define the domain considered for re-estimation (\code{"domain_spec"}).
By default this is the \code{"TRfull"} or \code{"RSAfull"} specification.}

\item{policy}{the refresh policy to apply (see details).}

\item{period, start, end}{additional parameters used when outliers are partially re-estimated (\code{policy = "Outliers"}) or to specify the span on which additive outliers are introduced,
normally at the end of the series  (\code{policy = "Current"}).
Span definition: \code{period}: numeric, number of observations in a year (12, 4...).
\code{start} and \code{end}: first and last date (included) where additive outliers are introduced or, in the case of re-estimation of outliers, start of the re-estimation (end is unused),
defined as arrays of two elements: year and first period (for example, if \code{period = 12}, \code{c(1980, 1)} for January 1980).
If they are not specified, the outliers will be re-identified on the whole series.}
}
\value{
a new specification, an object of class \code{"JD3_TRAMOSEATS_SPEC"} or
\code{"JD3_TRAMO_SPEC"}.
}
\description{
Function allowing to create a new specification by updating a specification used for a previous estimation.
Some selected parameters will be kept fixed (previous estimation results) while others will be freed for re-estimation
in a domain of constraints. See details and examples.
}
\details{
The selection of constraints to be kept fixed or re-estimated is called a revision policy.
User-defined parameters are always copied to the new refreshed specifications. Only the Tramo
(reg-arima pre-adjustment part) is refreshed, but the final ARIMA model handed down to SEATS for the decomposition part
might be changed as a result of the refreshing process.

Available refresh policies are:

\strong{Current}: applying the current pre-adjustment reg-arima model and adding the new raw data points as Additive Outliers (defined as new intervention variables)

\strong{Fixed}: applying the current pre-adjustment reg-arima model and replacing forecasts by new raw data points.

\strong{FixedParameters}: pre-adjustment reg-arima model is partially modified: regression coefficients will be re-estimated but regression variables, Arima orders
and coefficients are unchanged.

\strong{FixedAutoRegressiveParameters}: same as FixedParameters but Arima Moving Average coefficients (MA) are also re-estimated, Auto-regressive (AR) coefficients are kept fixed.
When using Seats for decomposition it avoids a possible re-allocation of roots between the trend and seasonal components,
which might have led to strong revisions.

\strong{FreeParameters}: all regression and Arima model coefficients are re-estimated, regression variables and Arima orders are kept fixed.

\strong{Outliers}: regression variables and Arima orders are kept fixed, but outliers will be re-detected on the defined span, thus all regression and Arima model coefficients are re-estimated

\strong{Outliers_StochasticComponent}: same as "Outliers" but Arima model orders (p,d,q)(P,D,Q) can also be re-identified.
